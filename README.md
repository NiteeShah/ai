Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of embeddings, Vector Databases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a fun rock concert metaphor. You'll learn how to:

- Create embeddings for data
- Set up a Vector Database
- Use RAG to enhance AI text generation

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install some essential libraries:


pip install numpy faiss-cpu transformers

Steps to Run the Code

Step 1: Run the file named setup_vector_database.py.

Step 2: Run the file named integrate_rag.py.
