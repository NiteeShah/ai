Vector Databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This is an AI assisted project.
This project showcases how to use embeddings, Vector Databases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance AI application performance.
You'll learn how to:

- Create embeddings for data
- Set up a Vector Database
- Use RAG to enhance AI text generation

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install some essential libraries:

Step 1: ai_rag_simple

Step 2: pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the file named sentence_embeddings.py (to see how the embeddings of your statements look like) 

Step 4: Run the file named naive_rag_from_text.py (to implement a simple RAG on your custom data and play around)
